    Use a loop to fill the greetings array with strings that use
    the firstName and lastName properties from each of the Person
    objects in the people variable.
    Each greeting string should say "Hello FIRST LAST!", where "FIRST" and "LAST" are replaced
    with the values from the person (firstName and lastName).

    Return the array of greetings.

    For instance, if the input to the static greet method of the
    Greeter class were two people named "Bill Barnes" and "Sally Smith,"
    the result would be an array of two Strings:
    "Hello Bill Barnes!"
    "Hello Sally Smith!"
